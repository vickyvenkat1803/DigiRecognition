# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a machine learning application that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a collection of 60,000 labeled digit images, and achieves high accuracy on unseen test data.

---

## **Features**
- Efficient preprocessing of the MNIST dataset.
- Built using TensorFlow and Keras frameworks.
- Implements a CNN for accurate digit recognition.
- Trains and tests the model with interactive visualizations.

---

## **Project Structure**
- `digit_recognition.py`: Main script that builds, trains, and evaluates the CNN model.
- `README.md`: Documentation for understanding and running the project.

---

## **Requirements**
Ensure you have Python (3.8–3.12) installed along with the following libraries:
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- scikit-learn

Install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras scikit-learn
